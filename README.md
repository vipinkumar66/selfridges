# selfridges
Hi vistors, there is a UK based website called https://www.selfridges.com/, this website has products like clothings, boots,etc.
So in this repository I have written a code that will be fetching the details of all the products under the cateogry for which the url is added to the url.txt file.
In this repo there are 3 main files, one is a python script another one is a json file that has all the xpath for the details of the product and the third file is a text file which will have the category url that you want to scrap.
In this I have also make use of the command line arguments, so to run this script you have to download the entire repo and then in your terminal type this command: python python_filename "json_file_name" "https://www.selfridges.com/"
The data which will be scrapped by this will get stored in the csv file.
                                                                              THANKYOU
